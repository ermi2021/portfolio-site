I developed the offline-first mobile app version of Dagu 2, using React Native and CouchDB/PouchDB. This empowers healthcare professionals in Ethiopian health facilities with uninterrupted inventory management, even in areas with limited connectivity. The app tracks medications, equipment, and vaccinations, providing tailored recordkeeping and seamless logistics procedures. Its timely stock reports enable effective decision-making for enhanced inventory control.
